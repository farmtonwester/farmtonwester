- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @farmtonwester, more commonly known by my unjumbled alias/real name, Weston Farmer!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, sports, mathematics, rollercoasters, video games, and chess.
- #ITookCS50

  
- ðŸŒ± I began by learning to program with Python. As a relative newbie to code, Python offered the friendly syntax which I did not yet know was necessary to get me in the door. I then honed in on web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. What's more, CS50's curriculum begins with MIT's Scratch, before hitting data structures in C, then introducing that triarchy of WebDev, along with some SQLite and Python frameworks/tools like Flask and Jinja. More recently, my focus has been reinforcing strong fundamentals of systems and networks, both at the hardware level and at that sweet, sweet intersection of the front-end and back-end.

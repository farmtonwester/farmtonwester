- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @farmtonwester, more commonly known by my unjumbled alias/real name, Weston Farmer!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in music, sports, mathematics, rollercoasters, video games, and chess.
- ðŸŒ± I began my coding journey by learning to program in Python, but I am now enrolled in a Flatiron Cohort and building out a foundational knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am always happy to learn and grow with others!
- ðŸ“« I can be reached via email at wesfarmer11@gmail.com or on Twitter @farmtonwester
